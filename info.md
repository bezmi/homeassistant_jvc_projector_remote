# JVC Projector IP Control component for Home Assistant

This is a custom [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) component to support IP control of JVC projectors. This should work with nearly any recent JVC projector as the IP control schema has not changed for some time.

Supported Commands:

- Power on/off
- Lens Memory
- Input (HDMI only)
- Power Status (Standby, Cooling, Emergency, Lamp On, Reserved)

For first time setup and configuration steps, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/alterbridge86/hass_custom_components/blob/master/custom_components/jvcprojector/README.md).
