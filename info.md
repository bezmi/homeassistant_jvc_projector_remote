# JVC Projector IP Control component for Home Assistant
WARNING: Version 2.0.0 of this custom component is a big update and contains changes that will break your config from the previous versions. Please see the [documentation](https://github.com/bezmi/homeassistant_jvc_projector_remote/blob/master/README.md).

This is a custom [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) component to support IP control of JVC projectors.
